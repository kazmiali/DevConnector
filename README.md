# DevConnector

> Social network for developers

This is a MERN stack application made by me. It is a small social network app that includes authentication, profiles and forum posts.

## Quick Start

```
# add  a default.json file in config folder

# this file is located in config/default.json

# add uri of your mongodb connection for example

 "mongoURI": "mongodb://localhost/dev-social",

```

```bash
# Install server dependencies
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install

# Run both Express & React from root
npm run dev

# Build for production
cd client
npm run build
```
